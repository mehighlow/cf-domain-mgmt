stored in the data structure everybody loves â€“ json(actually dictionary but can be easily transformed into json).

repo config to your SysOps/DevOps/SRE/Admins team

do not need any more and delete them safely.

Delete wrong DNS record? DO not remember the IP address has been removed? Everything can be easely found in your git
history.

# *CloudFlare domain management tool*
This script allows manage DNS records that are held in CloudFlare in declarative way.

# *Purpose of the tool:*
#### Play with DNS records:
-  create: *simply add new line like:*
```
- { name: 'newrecord.domain.com', content: '8.8.8.8', type: 'A', ttl: '1', proxy: 'true'  }

```
-  update: *set proxy to 'false'*
```
- { name: 'newrecord.domain.com', content: '8.8.8.8', type: 'A', ttl: '1', proxy: 'false'  }

```
-  detele: *simply delete the line*

#### Infrastrucure as code
DNS records are written in declarative way. Easy to parse and to manipulate with data that is
stored in the data structure everybody loves â€“ json(actually dictionary but can be easily transformed into json).
#### Team collaboration
No body needs password to your CF account. Everything happens via token access. You can grant rights to your domain
repo config to your SysOps/DevOps/SRE/Admins team
#### History of changes
You always knows what changes have been made and what for. So you can easily find records you 
do not need any more and delete them safely.
#### Backup
Delete wrong DNS record? DO not remember the IP address has been removed? Everything can be easely found in your git
history.
#### Quick DDoS protection:
Easy to set all records 'proxy:true' with security level you need.
#### Etc
- You can set your CI system to execute sript on push commit.
- You can set up and run only 'diffs' between config settings.
- No need to set different CF settings in web-based account.
